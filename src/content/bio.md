Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an educator and engineer currently working on curriculum at [Codesmith](https://codesmith.io), thinking deeply about how best to teach engineering for the modern web. I write code mostly in TypeScript & Rust, and I write prose mostly in English.

I live in [Lenapehoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapehoking), where I spend my time doing the things I love: birdwatching, reading fantasy novels, eating good food, finding a new favorite puzzle game, building local community, walking to the libray, getting too invested, and taking a deep breath. When in doubt, you can often find me sitting under a big tree with my dog Chico, usually in [Prospect Park](https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/park-map/).

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an educator and engineer currently working on curriculum at [Codesmith](https://codesmith.io), thinking deeply about how best to teach engineering for the modern web.

I live in [Lenapehoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapehoking), where I love birdwatching, reading fantasy novels, eating good food, finding a new favorite puzzle game, walking to the libray, and taking a deep breath. When in doubt, you can usually just find me sitting under a big tree in [Prospect Park](https://www.prospectpark.org/visit-the-park/park-map/).
